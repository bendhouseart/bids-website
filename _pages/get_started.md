# Get started

Read the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/).

If you have converted a dataset, use the [BIDS validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/validator.html).

# Learn from examples

You can find full datasets on [OpenNeuro.org](https://openneuro.org/public/datasets) and stripped down example datasets in the [bids-examples repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples) on GitHub.

# Confused? Need help?

Post a question on [NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids) or on the [BIDS discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion) email list.
